SharpStrike is a post-exploitation tool written in C# that uses either CIM or WMI to query remote systems. It can use provided credentials or the current user's session.

Note: Some commands will use PowerShell in combination with WMI, denoted with ** in the `--show-commands` command.

## Introduction

SharpStrike is a C# rewrite and expansion on [@Matt_Grandy_](https://twitter.com/Matt_Grandy_)'s [CIMplant](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/CIMplant) and [@christruncer](https://twitter.com/christruncer)'s [WMImplant](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/WMImplant). 

SharpStrike allows you to gather data about a remote system, execute commands, exfil data, and more. The tool allows connections using Windows Management Instrumentation, [WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi), or Common Interface Model, [CIM](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim) ; well more accurately Windows Management Infrastructure, [MI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure). CIMplant requires local administrator permissions on the target system.


## Setup:

It's probably easiest to use the built version under Releases, just note that it is compiled in Debug mode. If you want to build the solution yourself, follow the steps below.

1. Load SharpStrike.sln into Visual Studio
2. Go to Build at the top and then Build Solution if no modifications are wanted

The Build will produce two versions of SharpStrike: GUI (WinForms) & Console application. Each version implements the same features.

### Some Example Usage Commands

Console version:
![SharpStrike-Console](Extras/SharpStrike-Usage.gif?raw=true)


GUI version:
![SharpStrike-GUI](Extras/SharpStrike-GUI.png?raw=true)



## Solution Architecture
SharpStrike is composed of three main projects
1. ServiceLayer -- Provides core functionality and consumed by the UI layer
2. Models -- Contains types, shared across all projects
3. User Interface -- GUI/Console

### ServiceLayer
1. Connector.cs
> This is where the initial CIM/WMI connections are made and passed to the rest of the application

2. ExecuteWMI.cs
> All function code for the WMI commands

3. ExecuteCIM.cs
> All function code for the CIM (MI) commands
